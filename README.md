# Mandla African Language Keyboard 

## Live Link
<a href="https://keyboards.mandla.ai" target="_blank" > Live Link </a>

<p> I’ve been learning N’ko script for the past few months and am now wanting to type it. Unfortunately couldn’t find any existing online keyboards so I made one today. </p>

## Roadmap
<p>  I think in the long term I aim to support any African language script on this site + mabey release a chrome extension/ mobile keyboard to generalize use. Would also be cool to have a language agnostic (phonetic only) conversion between different scripts. </p>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
